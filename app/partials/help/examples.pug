h3 Examples

p There are many example Dashboards available with the tag
    a(href='/?q=babble-examples')
        strong  babble-examples
    |.  Each Widget's help page also includes relevent snippets of the examples.

p Under the covers, the Babble editor constructors the Dashboard definition in JSON.  Here's a brief example:
    pre.code.
        {
            "description": "This is an example",
            "name": "example-dashboard",
            "pages": [{
                "duration": 60,
                "frequency": 1,
                "layout": {
                    "gridColumns": 2,
                    "gridRows": 2
                },
                "widgets": [{
                    "widget": "clock"
                }]
            }],
            "theme": "dark"
        }
