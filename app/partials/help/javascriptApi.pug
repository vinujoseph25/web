h3 JavaScript API

p.
    Babble provides a JavaScript API that Dashboards can leverage. They make it easier to extend Babble with custom functionality and add additional interactivity to a Dashboard. Basically, it exposes various actions in the Dashboard (e.g. execute a Data Source, show/hide a Widget), or to provide information about the Dashboard.

p
    | In addition to the Babble API, there are a handful of 3rd party JavaScript libraries which are bundled with Babble. Theese are the libraries that Babble itself is built on, making them available for use by Dashboards as well. More information about these libraries can be found at

h4 Dashboard Information

table
    tr
        th Method/Property
        th Description
    tr
        td Babble.version
        td Property that returns the current version of Babble
    tr
        td Babble.dashboard
        td Property that returns the current Dashboard as an object
    tr
        td Babble.dashboardOverrides
        td Property that returns an object of user-specific overrides for the current Dashboard
    tr

        td Property that returns the name of the current Dashboard
    tr
        td Babble.pageName
        td Property that returns the name of the currently-displayed Page
    tr
        td Babble.currentUser
        td Property containing an object of information about the logged-in user. If authentication is not enabled, or if the user is not logged in, it will return null.
    tr
        td Babble.goToPage(pageNumber)
        td Navigates to a specific page in the Dashboard (starting with page 1)
    tr
        td Babble.getDeeplink()
        td Returns a deeplink URL to the current Dashboard, including the values of all Parameters

h4 Functions

p These functions are hooks into Babble that can be leveraged by Dashboards

table
    tr
        th Function
        th Description
    tr
        td Babble.functions.forceUpdate()
        td Forces Babble to do an internal update of Dashboard state, e.g. syncing parameters to the URL. In general, this should not be needed, but can be used to immediately trigger an update cycle after running custom JavaScript.
    tr
        td Babble.functions.exportData(format, data)
        td Downloads the provided data in one of the following formats: 'json', 'csv', 'xlsx'. CSV and XLSX are both tabular formats and may not be correctly formatted with nested data. See also 
            em  Babble.currentPage.widgets['widgetName'].exportData(format)
            | .
    tr
        td Babble.functions.recordEvent(eventData)
        td Records a custom Dashboard event to Babble's analytics database (if enabled). An object of custom key/value pairs can be provided, which are attached to the event. This function can be used to implement custom click tracking, error logging, etc.

h4 Built-In Parameters

p These Parameters are built-in to every Dashboard, and appear in the URL when set. They don't have to be configured manually in the Parameters section of the Dashboard, but they can be added there in order to change the default value.

table
    tr
        th Parameter
        th Description
    tr
        td Babble.parameters.page
        td Set to the current page number (as an integer)
    tr
        td Babble.parameters.rev
        td Set to the Dashboard's revision number (as a string); this will be undefined when viewing the latest revision
    tr
        td Babble.parameters.live
        td If true, causes the Dashboard to check for new Revisions more frequently. This Parameter can be set via URL only, when the Dashboard is loaded.
    tr
        td Babble.parameters.autoRotate
        td True/false value that enables/disables rotation in the Dashboard, overriding the Dashboard's setting. This Parameter can be set via URL only, when the Dashboard is loaded.

h4 Data Sources

p These functions allow interaction with the Data Sources in the Dashboard. The 
    em  Babble.dataSource
    |  object contains each Data Source name as a key, with an object of functions as the value.

table
    tr
        th Method
        th Description
    tr
        td Babble.dataSources['dataSourceName'].execute([showSpinners])
        td Manually executes a Data Source.  If showSpinners is true, it will triggers Widgets to show a loading spinner while the Data Source is executing
    tr
        td Babble.dataSources['dataSourceName'].getPromise()
        td Returns the latest execution promise (may be completed).  The returned promise has two functions, promise.then(function) and promise.catch(function).  If the Data Source has already completed, then() will execute the given function immediately. This function returns an object of resultsets, each containing columns (optional) and data.
    tr
        td Babble.dataSources['dataSourceName'].getCachedDataSet([resultSetName])
        td Returns the latest resultset for the Data Source if it exists, else null. If no resultSet argument is provided, the default resultset name of '0' will be used. This function returns the result set data directly.
    tr
        td Babble.dataSources['dataSourceName'].getData()
        td Deprecated; do not use
    tr
        td Babble.dataSources['dataSourceName'].init()
        td Initializes the Data Source and starts automatic refresh if configured. This method is used internally by Widgets; execute() is probably better suited to custom JavaScript scripting.
    
h4 Widgets

p These functions apply overrides to Widgets in the Dashboard. In order to use these functions, the Widget needs to have the
    em  name
    |  property configured; the 
    em  Babble.currentPage.widgets 
    |  object contains each Widget name as a key, with an object of functions as the value.

table
    tr
        th Method
        th Description
    tr
        td Babble.currentPage.widgets['widgetName'].show()
        td Shows a Widget; overrides the Widget's 
            em hidden
            |  property
    tr
        td Babble.currentPage.widgets['widgetName'].hide()
        td Hides a Widget; overrides the Widget's 
            em hidden
            |  property
    tr
        td Babble.currentPage.widgets['widgetName'].toggleVisibility()
        td Toggles the visibility of a Widget; overrides the Widget's 
            em hidden
            |  property
    tr
        td Babble.currentPage.widgets['widgetName'].exportData(format)
        td Downloads the data behind a Widget in one of the following formats: 'json', 'csv', 'xlsx'.  CSV and XLSX are both tabular formats and may not be correctly formatted with nested data. See also
            em  Babble.functions.exportData()
            | .

h4 BabbleData

p BabbleData has a JavaScript API for reading/writing data. This is documented separately on the 
    a(ng-click='findItem("BabbleData")', href='?q=BabbleData')  BabbleData
    |  page.
