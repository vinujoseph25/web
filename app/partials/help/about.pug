h3 About
p
    | Babble is a browser-based platform for creating dashboards.  
    | It provides standard boilerplate and plumbing, allowing non-programmers to easily create 
    | and edit dashboards using customizable components.  It has a built-in dashboard editor, 
    | and hosts the dashboards directly.

p
    | Dashboards are defined declaratively as a JSON document, which contains all the properties 
    | required to render the Dashboard. 

div(ng-repeat='message in selectedItem.messages', 
    class='bg-{{ message.type || info }}')
    i.fa(ng-class='message.icon || fa-info-circle')
    .inner(data-ng-bind-html='message.html')

h4 When Should I Use Babble?

p.
    Babble is best thought of as an alternative to custom, light-weight websites that visualize data.  It provides the web hosting,
    page layout, data loading, and assorted widgets&mdash;all without writing code.  In contrast, building a comparable website 
    from scratch would require provisioning a server/VM, choosing the appropriate web frameworks and libraries, and writing 
    the code for the site.  Using Babble simplifies this process dramatically, making it ideal for rapid development and prototyping.
p.
    However, Babble implements a limited set of widgets, although the HTML and Javascript widgets do allow for a wide degree
    of customization with some coding.  Babble works best with minimally-interactive dashboards, as it lacks more robust 
    interaction features like dependent widgets and triggers.
p.
    Through various Data Sources, Babble can pull data from databases, web services, etc. It's possible to do light data processing and massaging in Babble, but it is not a replacement for ETL processes or SQL queries. In this regard, Babble is ideal as a front-end for an existing database or web service. Babble does have a very lightweight data backend for storing Dashboard data, but this is not a replacement for databases as it is limited in storage space and lacks any kind of processing.
p.
    Finally, Babble has automatic page rotation and data-refreshing features, making it well-suited to hosting status boards and monitoring dashboards.  It is less suitable for generating 
    reports (although PDF export is available).
